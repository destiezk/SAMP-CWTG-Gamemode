# SAMP-CWTG-Gamemode
Due to my lack of interest in SAMP I decided to release one of my CW/TG gamemodes.

The gamemode connects to a MySQL database which stores users' details e.g username, password, adminlevel.

I have attached the SQL file which you need to upload to your database in order to make the gamemode work.
At some places it might be pasted, only little functions which I did not want to rewrite though.
Have fun.
